  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    After building a successful career as a software engineer,
    I made the deliberate choice to follow a lifelong passion and transition
    full-time into live sound engineering. This move combines my technical
    precision with my love for live performance. Known for exceptional
    preparation, calm troubleshooting of everything from simple fixes to complex
    system failures, and a consistent willingness to go above and beyond to
    support the team and the show.
  </p>
  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <h3>Freelance System Engineer &amp; Sound Engineer &mdash; 2015-present</h3>
  <p>Delivered consistently high-level audio as A1/A2 across clubs, theaters, arenas, stadium tours, festivals, corporate events, and weddings for clients including Hard Rock Live (house crew), Technotrix, Reggies, Audible Sound Productions, and artist directly.</p>
  <p>Excelled in high-pressure, rapid-turnover environments – from no-soundcheck corporate gala bands (jazz trios to 16-piece ensembles) to multi-act festival days.</p>
  <p>Proven team leader and client-facing professional: built systems from the ground up, managed stage crews, interfaced directly with artists and tour management, and mentored junior engineers while maintaining a “never the weak link” reputation.</p>
  <p>Thrived in all-hands cultures where we all still push cases, coil cable, load trucks, repair gear, and set barricade – consistently volunteering for overtime, doubles, and last-minute calls to ensure zero failures.</p>
  <p>Rapidly troubleshoot and resolve issues from basic cable faults to complex Dante/network and wireless conflicts, routinely preventing delays and protecting show continuity under tight schedules.</p>

  <h3>SOFTWARE ENGINEER &mdash; 2007-2015</h3>
  <p>Developed and maintained scalable software solutions for diverse clients in the tech sector, honing expertise in coding, system architecture, and rapid problem-solving.</p>
  <p>Collaborated on cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality applications, fostering skills in troubleshooting complex technical issues under tight deadlines.</p>
  <p>Leveraged a robust technology foundation to transition seamlessly into live sound engineering, applying analytical thinking and diagnostic abilities to optimize audio systems, resolve real-time glitches, and enhance event production efficiency.</p>
