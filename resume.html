  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I gave up my career as a software engineer to work in live entertainment as
    a sound engineer. This has been my passion since I was kid and I was finally
    able to make it happen. I’m always willing to go the extra mile and be
    prepared to troubleshoot the most basic to the most complex issues or just to
    give an extra hand.
